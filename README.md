# Beep-Beep-AI
Beep Beep AI is a computer vision model that detects road signs (traffic lights, stop signs, speed limit signs, etc.) from a live feed video or static picture and returns audio feedback ("stop sign ahead") from live feed videos to assist drivers on the road. 

Used roboflow for managing our dataset of 3210 images, performing pre-processing and augmentation steps, and training our final model for deployment

Our dataset consists of web-scraped Google images using SerpAPI

For the front-end, we used HTML/CSS/JS along with a Bootstrap Template, pairing it with Flask as our back-end
